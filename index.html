                Before starting at Tech Elevator, I decided to teach myself how to code. I started with HTML/CSS and Javascript.
                As I was learning, a friend of mine needed a website for his painting company and I decided to design it for him.
                There was a lot of learning on the job, but doing this website really sparked my love for programming and was one of the reasons I decided to attend Tech Elevator to accelerate my learning.
                The website is coded from scratch using no templates. One of my favorite features of the site are the sliders that show before and after pictures of previous paint jobs that he did.

                    <p>A partner and myself were given the class project of designing a website that stores information about National Parks.
                      The use cases were that each National Park would have a detail page which displays information about the park and
                      it’s upcoming 5 day weather forecast. On top of creating a dynamic, responsive website, we created a mobile companion
                      application that we named Trailblazer. Each park would have a number of markers at the park’s points of interest.
                      When the user scans one of these markers with their phone, the app displays to the user their current location,
                      interesting facts about the location, nearby points of interest, and accomodations, using augmented reality.

                <p>This project came about when I was picking out a card for a friend’s birthday.
                  As I was muttering about having to pay $5 dollars for a fancy piece of paper, I realized that
                  greeting cards would be a great medium for augmented reality. When the user points their phone at the card,
                  it displays 3D, augmented reality, content and plays the “Happy Birthday” song.
                  I am currently working on expanding the app to include a web application that the person giving the card
                  can use to add a personal message. Using SQL, the message would display when the user opens their card.

                  <p >Before attending Tech Elevator, I was a touring musician and toured all across the country.
                    When that started to die down I worked in the music business where I founded my own concert promotion
                    company and worked as an artist manager helping bands develop their brands.
                    Through this I learned the power of technology and began to teach myself to code. I realized that a coding bootcamp
                    like Tech Elevator was the best way to accelerate this learning so that I could began building programs faster.<br /> <br /> Currently, I am
                    developing a handful of Augmented and Virtual applications. I am intrigued on how these technologies are able to hide and ,
                    in some cases, completly remove the so called "fourth wall" between technology and its users.
